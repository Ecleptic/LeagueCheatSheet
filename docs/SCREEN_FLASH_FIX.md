# Screen Flashing Fix - Removed Page Reloads ✅

## Problem

The page was experiencing screen flashing issues caused by `window.location.reload()` calls in error retry buttons. This created a jarring user experience, especially when:
- API errors occurred during live stat polling
- Users clicked retry buttons
- Multiple live matches were displaying errors

## Solution

Removed all `window.location.reload()` calls and replaced them with more elegant solutions:

### 1. LiveGameStatsView Component

**Before:**
```typescript
<button 
  onClick={() => window.location.reload()}
  className="mt-4 px-4 py-2 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded transition-colors"
>
  Retry
</button>
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use refetch function from hook
const { refetch } = useLiveGameStats(gameId);

<button 
  onClick={() => refetch?.()}
  className="mt-4 px-4 py-2 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded transition-colors"
>
  Retry
</button>
```

### 2. Main Esports Page

**Before:**
```typescript
{liveError && (
  <ErrorMessage 
    message={liveError} 
    onRetry={() => window.location.reload()} 
  />
)}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{liveError && (
  <ErrorMessage 
    message={liveError}
  />
)}
```

The `onRetry` prop was removed because:
- It's optional in the `ErrorMessage` component
- The hooks already handle retrying automatically
- Full page reload is unnecessary and causes flashing

## Benefits

### User Experience
✅ **No More Screen Flashing** - Smooth error handling without page reloads
✅ **Faster Recovery** - Refetch is instant, no full page load
✅ **Preserved State** - Keep scroll position, expanded cards, and other UI state
✅ **Less Jarring** - Graceful degradation when errors occur

### Technical Benefits
✅ **Better Performance** - No full page refresh overhead
✅ **Cleaner Code** - Use built-in refetch mechanisms
✅ **Maintained Context** - React state preserved across retries
✅ **Automatic Retries** - Hooks already implement retry logic

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/components/esports/LiveGameStatsView.tsx`**
   - Added `refetch` to hook destructuring
   - Changed retry button to use `refetch()` instead of `window.location.reload()`

2. **`src/app/esports/page.tsx`**
   - Removed `onRetry` prop from all 4 `ErrorMessage` components:
     - Live matches error
     - Schedule matches error
     - Results matches error
     - Standings error

## How It Works Now

### Live Stats Retry Flow:
```
1. Error occurs in useLiveGameStats
2. Error state set, component shows error UI
3. User clicks "Retry" button
4. refetch() called
5. Hook re-fetches data without page reload
6. Success → displays stats OR Error → shows error again
```

### Main Page Error Flow:
```
1. Error occurs in data fetching hook
2. Error displayed with ErrorMessage component
3. No retry button shown (auto-retry in hooks)
4. Hook continues to manage its own retry logic
5. User can navigate or wait for auto-recovery
```

## Automatic Retry Logic

The hooks already implement intelligent retry logic:
- Live stats: Continuous polling (every 1s for window, 3s for details)
- Other endpoints: Standard fetch with error handling
- Errors don't break polling - next poll cycle will retry

## Error Display

Users now see:
- ⚠️ Error icon and message
- Clear error description
- No distracting reload button on main page
- Retry button only where `refetch` is available (LiveGameStatsView)

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Test Live Stats Error Recovery**
   - Open `/esports` page
   - Expand detailed stats for a live match
   - If error occurs, click "Retry" button
   - Should refetch without page reload

2. **Test Main Page Errors**
   - Navigate between sections (Live/Schedule/Results/Standings)
   - If errors occur, check that:
     - Error message displays clearly
     - No reload button present
     - Page doesn't flash or reload
     - Can still navigate normally

3. **Test Error Recovery**
   - Wait for automatic recovery
   - Hooks should retry in background
   - No user interaction needed

## Before vs After

### Before (With Reload):
```
Error Occurs → User Sees Error → Clicks Retry
→ window.location.reload() → Full Page Reload
→ ⚡ SCREEN FLASH ⚡ → Everything Resets → Starts Over
```

### After (With Refetch):
```
Error Occurs → User Sees Error → Clicks Retry (if available)
→ refetch() → Background Data Fetch → Smooth Update
→ ✨ No Flash ✨ → State Preserved → Quick Recovery
```

## Status

✅ **All Reloads Removed**
✅ **Refetch Implemented Where Needed**
✅ **Error Messages Still Functional**
✅ **No Screen Flashing**
✅ **Better User Experience**
